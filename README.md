# AI Traffic Management System üö¶  

An intelligent traffic light control system that dynamically adjusts timings based on real-time traffic congestion using OpenCV and Neural Networks.  

---

## üìú Project Overview  
Traffic congestion is a persistent challenge in urban areas, resulting in wasted time, frustration, and environmental harm. Traditional traffic light systems are static and unable to respond to real-time conditions, leading to inefficiency.  

Our solution introduces a **smart traffic management system** that uses **computer vision** and **machine learning** to dynamically optimize traffic light timings, minimizing delays and reducing emissions.
